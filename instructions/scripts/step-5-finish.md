# Step 5: Finished! - Script

And there you have it - you've built a privacy-preserving transfer system on Solana using zero-knowledge proofs!

---

We built a private transfer pool where:
- Deposits are hidden behind cryptographic commitments
- Withdrawals reveal nothing about which deposit is being spent
- Double-spending is prevented without revealing identity

## Solana Concepts We Practiced

We practised Anchor macros, CPIs, PDAs, and learned a little bit more about Kit. We also generated a ZK verifier, learned about ZK verifying, and a bit more about Solana compute budgets and transaction sizes. And we learned best practices when it comes to handling ZK on Solana, all about merkle trees, commitments and nullifiers, Poseidon, and how to keep things private on a public ledger.

Congratulations and enjoy the rest of the bootcamp!
